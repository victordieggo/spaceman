# Spaceman

Spaceman is a simple and easily customizable HTML/CSS boilerplate to build websites and apps. It provides a flexbox based responsive layout system, pre-set styles for basic UI elements and a few CSS utilities and components.

### Getting Started

[Download Spaceman](https://github.com/victordieggo/spaceman/releases/latest) and extract all files into the root directory of your project. The build system is based on [Vite](https://vite.dev/) so you'll need [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed first. Once you have set it up, access the bash/terminal/command line:

```
# go to your project directory
$ cd myproject

# install dev dependencies
$ npm i

# start the development server at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# preview and test the production-optimized build
$ npm run preview

# after editing your app, build it to the /dist directory
$ npm run build
```
### Browser Support
